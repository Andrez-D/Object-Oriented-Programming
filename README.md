# Object-Oriented-Programming
python program that shows class and polymorphism.

Explanation:
Animal is the parent class with a general move() method and encapsulated _age attribute with getter and setter.

Dog and Bird inherit from Animal and override move() to show polymorphic behavior.

Objects are created with unique initial values using constructors.

Encapsulation is shown by keeping _age protected and accessing it via getter/setter.
